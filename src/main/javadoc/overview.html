<h1>Grammaticus is a localization library that allows the end users the ability
to rename nouns while maintaining grammatical correctness. </h1>
This library was
built to support the needs of allowing an end-user or customer to change the
names of things used in an application. Those things are referred to as
"nouns".

Salesforce has a feature called "Rename Tabs &amp; Labels" which lets
administrators change the name of standard Salesforce objects such as
Account, Contact, and Task. However, the application often wants to display a
string such as <code>Open an Account</code>, which if you renamed <code>Account</code> to <code>Client</code>, would
look strange and grammatically incorrect: Open an Client. In order to support
this feature, a custom label file format used. To easy the burden of
translators and the use of translation memory, the label file format is XML
and split into sections and keys. Use XML entities to represent the nouns,
adjectives, and articles, such as <code>Open &lt;a/&gt; &lt;Account/&gt;</code> for the label above.

Use of this library puts extra burden on your developers and localizers to
make sure that you neither hard-code names of renameable nouns nor use string
concatenation for renameable objects. It also requires end-users to provide
extra grammatical information around the nouns they are renaming, such as
gender, starting with a vowel, and multiple forms for number, cases,
articles, or possession. The grammar engine prevents your application from
feeling foreign, and allows expansion of your application to nouns defined by
the customer. Salesforce extensively uses this feature with Custom Objects,
allowing standard screens to say All My Puppies through the label &lt;All/&gt;
&lt;My/&gt; &lt;Entity entity="0"/&gt;. You can also encode multiple parts of the label
based on plural rules around an argument, such as 1 item vs 2 items in
English, or have verb agreement with a noun for Semitic languages using the
&lt;gender&gt; tag.

Grammaticus encodes the article, noun, and adjective declensions for 30+
languages and supports programmatic use of nouns through the Renameable
interface. The default label files included in testing provide a set of
adjectives and articles already translated by salesforce, along with some
sample nouns.

Grammaticus includes an offline mode for use in browsers and
non-java languages that support javascript. When using offline mode, the
browser downloads the grammaticus.js engine into a local variable which then
gets overridden based on the language, and set of terms you want to decline
offline. The terms can be cached locally, and only the renamable terms need
to be downloaded. The API for the offline grammar engine is currently in beta
and subject to change.

The files for translation are split into three different types

<ul>
<li>names.xml: The dictionary of all the nouns in a given language that your
customers will be allowed to change in each form for the language</li>
<li>adjectives.xml: The dictionary of all all of the adjectives and articles you
may need to conjugate for your customers </li>
<li>labels.xml (and imports): The labels
themselves.</li>
</ul>

You can load labels from a file system, from a jar file, or from
a known URL. Some helpful classes around managing IniFiles are included as
well for managing censoring sensitive information from log files.

Some default behaviors (such as the list of supported languages) can be
overridden by specifying an "i18n.properties" file in /com/force/i18n of your
jar file. You will want to override the LanguageProvider to return only the
set of languages supported by your application.

Known Limitations:

<ul>
<li>Partitive articles are not available.</li>
<li>Many incomplete or unsupported
declensions are provided for certain languages, because Salesforce doesn't
translate into them. See UnsupportedLanguageDeclension</li>
<li> Dual Number is
supported only in Arabic and Slovenian. There is use of dual in other
languages such as Hebrew, but they only apply to a handful of irregular
nouns, so for simplicity, it is not supported.</li>
<li> US English is considered to be
the base language, and while specifying a different base language is
supported, it hasn't been tested.</li>
</ul>
