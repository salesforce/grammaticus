/**
 * <p>Modeled closely after the {@code java.util.Set} class, except it
 * uses {@code int}s instead of {@code Object}s.</p>
 *
 * <p>The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
 * that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
 * (as defined above).</p>
 *
 * Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
 * elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
 * is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is
 * an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition is that it is
 * not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
 *
 * Beta class. Classes under com.force.i18n.commons package will be moved into a dedicated project.
